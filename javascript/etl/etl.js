// Step 1 - Problem Understanding:

// * What are the expected inputs?
//    * Data type: Object
//    * Description: An object where keys are numerical scores (points) and values are arrays of uppercase letters representing letters that share the same score.

// * What are the expected outputs?
//    * Data type: Object
//    * Description: An object where keys are individual letters (lowercase) and values are numerical scores.

// * What are the key rules or constraints?
//    * The transformation involves changing from a score-to-letters mapping (one-to-many) to a letter-to-score mapping (one-to-one).
//      - {1: ["A", "E"], 2: ["D", "G"]} -> {"a": 1, "d": 2, "e": 1, "g": 2}
//    * Letters should be stored in lowercase in the new format
//    * The goal is to transform the legacy data format to the new format. The transformation must preserve accuracyâ€”each letter retains its original score.

// * What is the mental model?
//    * A reorganization of data that maintains the same information but in a format better suited for the game's expanded language support.

// Step 2 - Examples:

// Step 3 - Strategies:

// Step 4 - Algorithm design:

// Step 5 - Implementation:

export const transform = () => {
  throw new Error("Remove this statement and implement this function");
};
